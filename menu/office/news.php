        <h3>Quick Guide</h3>
        Your goal is to go up leagues, make money and get new cars! Buy a car in the cardealer. Drive a few beginner races and make your first bucks.
        You will get money and experience points, which you will see in the upper left grey box. To make your car faster (and win more money), 
        build some tuning parts. If you are lucky, some parts may be rare and better! Put them in your car and drive new races.
        
        <h3>What's planned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>UI Improvments (more filters etc)</li>
            <li>Car Market & Driver Market</li>
